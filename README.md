# Under Construction
A small and simple app to be used as a place holder until the real app is released.

## Usage
### Manual
Just use any server to serve static files found in `static` directory.

<!-- ### Docker
You can also use the docker image which uses [miniserve](https://github.com/svenstaro/miniserve) to serve the static files. -->
